Javascript project <br /> <br />
The purpose of this project is to create a trivia website that displays a question and accepts a user response. <br />
Upon completion of the trivia round the website will then display how many answers the user got correct. <br />
The game round will consist of 10 random questions drawn frm a pool. <br />

The goal of the project is to strengthen web development skills and familiarize myself with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and EC2.
